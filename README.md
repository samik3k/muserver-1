Programm edits ServerList.bmd. It has ability of changing server types(Gold,PVP,Non-PVP,Normal). Numbers in table from 1 to 15 is server indexes, you can type there these numbers : 
3 - Gold
2 - Gold Pvp
1 - Non-PVP
0 - Normal
Old versions of ServerList.bmd also had Description of server, so I decided to leave it as it is, so you can also edit older's version of this files.

0-19 1st main server
20-39 2nd main server
40-59 3rd main server
